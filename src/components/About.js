          <p>
            Hi! My name is Jalen Lum, and I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science
            at the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa with the goal of becoming a software developer.
            I was born and raised in Hawai'i on the island of Oahu, where I developed a deep passion
            for using technology to harness its transformative potential and create innovative solutions.
            I aspire to improve my skills as a software developer and am eager to do so by collaborating 
            with and learning from experienced professionals.
          </p>
